<!-- Using what we've learned about loops and conditionals, solve this classic coding challenge (it's been a favorite in interviews for years).

Write code that will go through each number from 1 to 100 and:

    For each number that is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
    For each number that is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
    For numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
    All other numbers should just print normally -->
